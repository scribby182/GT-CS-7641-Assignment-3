This is the code developed to complete Georgia Tech CS 7641 (Machine Learning) assignment 2 (Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction).

The objective was to test four dimensionality reduction algorithms:

* Random Hill Climbing
* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm
* MIMIC

And two Clustering techniques:

* K-Means
* Expectation Maximization

The code is broken up into a Jupyter Notebook for each problem. Supporting helper functions are contained in utilities.py.
